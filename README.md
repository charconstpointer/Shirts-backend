# T-Shirt Shopping App
POSTing a Shirt
```
{
    "size":"XL",
    "color":"White",
    "count": 100
}
```



Database schema (postgreSQL) if you want to run this app yourself, please keep in mind you need to add some shirts first for this app to work, and use only english color names, they're used later in my frontend app to stylize icons
